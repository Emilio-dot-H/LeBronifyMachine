Intro ~ If you frequent r/nba a lot, have some friends who frequent the subreddit, or simply spend enough time scrolling through NBA social media. Odds are you have come across a LeJoke. A play on words originating as a meme where you take the first part of Lebron James' name ("Le") and attach it to a word of your choosing.. Hate them, love them, or dread them. LeMemes are inevitable. Anytime Lebron James makes any headline, whether good or bad, there's a myriad of nicknames flooding the comments section inspired by the unique spelling format of 'LeBron'. And much like any massive trend, there's brilliant execution and there's uninspired blunders. Nonetheless, whether you're trying to up your LeGame, farm creativity (or karma), or you want to impress that cute girl in your office who has a weird LeNse of humor. I have just the solution for you!
