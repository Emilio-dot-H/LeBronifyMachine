# The Lebronify Machine ~ [www.lebronifymachine.com](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/)

***Intro*** **\~** If you frequent [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) a lot, have some friends who frequent the subreddit, or simply spend enough time scrolling through NBA social media. Odds are you have come across a LeJoke. A play on words originating as a meme where you take the first part of Lebron James' name ("Le") and attach it to a word of your choosing.. Hate them, love them, or dread them. LeMemes are inevitable. Anytime Lebron James makes any headline, whether good or bad, there's a myriad of nicknames flooding the comments section inspired by the unique spelling format of 'LeBron'. And much like any massive trend, there's brilliant execution and there's uninspired blunders. Nonetheless, whether you're trying to up your LeGame, farm creativity (or karma), or you want to impress that cute girl in your office who has a weird LeNse of humor. I have just the solution for you!

>The Le-jokes are funny in the way dad jokes are. They’re mostly purposefully corny but every once in a while one might make you genuinely chuckle.

***A lot of blood, sweat. and JavaScript*** \~ I coded a website from scratch and implemented an algorithm that scavenges through interfaces/modules (notably words from MyThes, the open-office thesaurus, and the offline database of [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com/)) to generate synonyms and transform them into 'LeWords'. On top of the synonym generator, there is also a Hero/Villain and Pokémon feature. Access a databank of popular superheroes and supervillains or a list of +900 Pokémon and watch them LeTransfrom.

***Here's a sample of what the*** [*website*](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/) ***can produce*** **\~ Example**

Input word: *God*

Results:

* LeSupreme Being - (Supreme Being)
* LeSupernatural Being - (supernatural being)
* LeSuperior - (superior)
* LeImage - (image)
* LeFfigy - (effigy)
* LeSuperordinate - (superordinate)
* LeImmortal - (immortal)

***Summary*** **\~** [The Lebronify Machine](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/) project is in large part dedicated to the [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) community. Lebron James is a high-level athlete and a bonafide superstar in the NBA. The play on words originated as a meme where you take the first part of Lebron James' name ("Le") and attach it to a word of your choosing.

***The algorithm*** **\~** Logic: The 1st and 3rd letter of every word must always be capitalized.

* If an 'o' is found in the 1st or 2nd slot. Attach 'LeBr' to word. (ie.: Ostrich → LeBrostrich)

* If an 'i' is found in the 1st or 2nd slot. Swap 'i' with 'Le'. (ie.: Imagination → LeMagination)

* If an 'e' is found in the 1st or 2nd slot. Place 'L' accordingly. (ie.: Elephant → LeLephant )

* Else: Attach 'Le' to the front of the word.


***Features*** **\~** Check them out at [https://www.lebronifymachine.com/](https://www.lebronifymachine.com/)

* **Synonyms:** Enter a word into the search box. The machine will generate a list of synonyms and run its algorithm to transform each synonym into a 'LeWord'.
* **Hero/Villain:** A list of popular hero and villain names is randomly generated and LeTransformed. *No input required.*
* **Pokémon:** A list of Pokémon names is randomly generated and LeTransformed. *No input required.*

***DISCLAIMER! \~*** The website/link is in no means intended to be a call to action. This is a fun lighthearted project I made with the community in mind. Also, I love LeBron!

***Honorable Mentions***

Thank you u/swansonben for the Gold Award.

Thank you u/Sim888 for the Helpful Awards.

***Updates made thanks to community feedback:***

* trim() implemented. No more blank spaces getting in your way.
* Easter eggs.
* More vowels added to the algorithms. 'i' gets turned into 'e' depending on location and length of word. (Intense --> LeNtense). And 'o' gets a 'LeBr' attachment. (Oyster --> LeBroyster) or (Ontario --> LeBrontario).

Also s/o to the mods for the amazingly hilarious tag LOL
